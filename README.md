# Blender-3D-modeling
This is a project about 3D modeling using Blender.

**Final Result.jpg** is the final image of my model.  
**Middle Presenttion.pdf** is something I build in the midterm of project.  
**Final Presenttion.pdf** is something I build after the midterm of project.  
**Blender Midterm Project** and **Blender Final Project** are two folders with the blender project in them.  

Feel free to use the model I build and if you have any idea or question, welcome to tell me.    
And I hope you guys can also upload your project so that we can learn from each other.
